# Flashcards
An application that allows a user to create their own flashcards to help with their studies. Personally, I learn by repetition and wanted to create a tool that will help me and others in our learning journey.
## How to use:
Each flashcard will have a title and defintion that the user will input and save to the database. The cards are available for interaction, such as flipping them over, after initial submission.
## Tech
- Go
- MongoDB
- JavaScript
- Docker
- HTML/CSS
## Ongoing plans:
- ~~Dockerize~~
- Randomize cards
- Allow user to delete and edit cards
- Create categories for specific flashcard topics
